 quick 'n dirty recursive grep search for files all match a list of regexes
## Usage

## Why name it srcy??
* 'sausy' as in rancy/sassy
* SRC as in source code or as in SRCy like source code - "esque"
* src Y as in the 'Y' is a "fork"/split/union of two seperate searches also a "combination" of code "paths"
